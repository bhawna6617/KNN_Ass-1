This method leverages the assumption that similar data points have similar feature values.\n",

    "# Weighted KNN: Instead of treating all neighbors equally, a weighted KNN approach assigns different weights to neighbors based on their similarity to the query point. When computing the weighted average for regression or the weighted voting for classification, neighbors that are more similar to the query point are given higher weights. This way, neighbors with missing values that are less similar to the query point contribute less to the prediction.\n",

    "# Multiple Imputation: Instead of imputing missing values with a single value, multiple imputation generates multiple plausible values for each missing value based on the observed data distribution. Each dataset with imputed values is then used to train a separate KNN model, and the final prediction is often obtained by averaging over the predictions from multiple models. Multiple imputation can capture uncertainty in the imputed values and provide more robust predictions."
